# ⚒️ THE DEV ENVIRONMENT: THE RUNESMITH'S FORGE

*Curated by Bard, the Drunken Dwarf Runesmith*

Before you can forge your neon runes, you must prepare your anvil, your hammer, and your workspace. This document lists the essential tools and configurations for a professional development environment.

---

## 🏗️ THE CORE FORGE (SYSTEM TOOLS)
*The heavy machinery of the smithy.*

- **Rust Toolchain**: `rustup`, `cargo`, `rustc`. The lifeblood of our projects.
- **Git & GitHub CLI (`gh`)**: For managing the flow of code and collaborating with other masters.
- **Docker**: For sealing your creations in magical crates to ensure they run anywhere.
- **Build Essentials**: `gcc`, `make`, `cmake`, `pkg-config`, `libssl-dev`. The raw iron for your forge.
- **Buildroot & QEMU**: For forging entire systems from the bedrock and testing them in pocket dimensions.
- **LLVM/Clang**: For deep inspections and optimizations.

## 🖋️ THE RUNIC CHISELS (EDITORS & IDEs)
*The tools that carve the code.*

- **Neovim (S-Tier)**: My personal choice. Highly modular and fast.
- **Helix**: A modern, modal alternative that's gaining power.
- **VS Code**: A reliable workshop for those who prefer more visual aids.
- **Rust-Analyzer**: The all-seeing eye for your Rust code.

---

## 🖥️ THE VIEWING MIRRORS (TERMINAL & SHELL)
*Seeing what you've forged.*

- **Kitty**: The GPU-accelerated window into the machine's heart.
- **Zsh with Starship**: A custom-forged prompt that shows your git status and system health.
- **Eza**: A modern replacement for `ls` that shows file types with colors and icons.
- **Bat**: A better `cat` with syntax highlighting for your runes.
- **Fd & Rg**: Fast tools for finding files and searching through code.

---

## 🛠️ THE RUNESMITH'S KIT (UTILITIES)
*Small tools that make the work smoother.*

- **Bottom (`btm`)**: For watching your system's pulse.
- **Yazi**: A fast, terminal-based file manager to navigate your hoard.
- **Staging Folders**:
  - `~/forge/`: Where all your active projects live.
  - `~/forge/scratch/`: For quick experiments (< 7 days).
  - `~/forge/archive/`: For completed works.

---

## 📜 THE SACRED CONFIGURATIONS (DOTFILES)
*The runes that define your workspace.*

- **`.bashrc` / `.zshrc`**: The basic spells for your shell.
- **`kitty.conf`**: Tuning your terminal's performance and aesthetics.
- **`starship.toml`**: Defining how your prompt speaks to you.
- **`Cargo.toml`**: The blueprint for your Rust projects.
- **`.editorconfig`**: Ensuring all smiths follow the same formatting rules.

---

## 🍻 THE WORKFLOW
1.  **Always Be Backing Up (ABB)**: Commit often, push daily.
2.  **Always Be Testing (ABT)**: `cargo test` is your best friend.
3.  **Keep Commits Small (KCS)**: One change, one commit.
4.  **Stay Thirsty**: Keep learning new runes and refining your craft.

## Session: 2026-02-20 – Block 1: Panic Elimination

### Summary
Eliminated panics in production paths by wrapping fallible operations in `anyhow::Result` and surfacing errors via the `InstallerError` contract. Added context to logging.rs and zsh.rs so failures now carry advice strings that guide the miner toward the correct incantation.

### Deliverables
- [x] Wrapped `std::fs::create_dir_all` in `anyhow::Context` inside `logging.rs`.
- [x] Guarded `zsh.rs` `chsh` call with `anyhow::Context` and advice.
- [x] Verified `cargo test` still passes (68 tests).
- [x] Ran `cargo fmt` and `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings` (clean).

### Build Status
- cargo fmt: clean
- cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings: clean
- cargo test: 68 tests passing

## Session: 2026-02-20 – Block 2: I/O Purification

### Summary
Purified the core of direct I/O by injecting `PkgBackend` behind a trait boundary and routing all filesystem writes through `SystemOps`. The `dry_run` flag now gates every write, and the `InstallationReport` captures every attempted action for later audit.

### Deliverables
- [x] Created `SystemOps` trait and `RealSystem` implementation.
- [x] Wired `PkgBackend` through the trait in `orchestrator.rs`.
- [x] Added `dry_run` guards in `config.rs` and `doctor.rs`.
- [x] Extended `InstallationReport` to track dry-run actions.
- [x] Verified `cargo test` passes (72 tests).

### Build Status
- cargo fmt: clean
- cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings: clean
- cargo test: 72 tests passing

## Session: 2026-02-20 – Block 3: Error Surfacing

### Summary
Surfaced previously swallowed errors as warnings in `docker.rs`, `rust.rs`, `zsh.rs`, and `github.rs`. Each warning now carries a clear message and, where possible, a recovery path so the miner can resume without restarting the entire ritual.

### Deliverables
- [x] Added `log::warn!` calls in `docker.rs` for Docker daemon timeouts.
- [x] Surfaced GitHub API rate-limit warnings in `github.rs`.
- [x] Guarded Rust toolchain download in `rust.rs` with retry logic.
- [x] Verified `cargo test` passes (74 tests).

### Build Status
- cargo fmt: clean
- cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings: clean
- cargo test: 74 tests passing

---

## Session: 2026-02-20 – Block 4: API Tightening

### Summary
Tightened the public API surface by removing `RealSystem` from the `installer-core` exports and exposing only the trait-bound `SystemOps`. Updated downstream crates (`installer-arch`, `installer-debian`, `installer-fedora`) to use the trait.

### Deliverables
- [x] Removed `pub use RealSystem` from `lib.rs`.
- [x] Updated driver crates to use `dyn SystemOps`.
- [x] Verified `cargo test --all` passes (78 tests).

### Build Status
- cargo fmt: clean
- cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings: clean
- cargo test --all: 78 tests passing

---

## Session: 2026-02-20 – Block 5: Green Build Confirmation

### Summary
Confirmed the green build trilogy (fmt + clippy + test) and documented the current state in `docs/mining-projects/maps.md`. Pushed the `work` branch and opened PR #6 for merge to `main`.

### Deliverables
- [x] Ran `cargo fmt` (no changes).
- [x] Ran `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings` (clean).
- [x] Ran `cargo test --all` (82 tests passing).
- [x] Updated `docs/mining-projects/maps.md` with Block 1-5 summary.
- [x] Pushed `work` branch and opened PR #6.

### Build Status
- cargo fmt: clean
- cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings: clean
- cargo test --all: 82 tests passing

## Guiding Principles

- **Gates before gold**: CI lockdown before features
- **Stamp before ship**: Tagged releases before distribution
- **Test before extend**: Driver harness before new phases
- **Foundation before facade**: Core stability before TUI polish
- **Green before merge**: fmt + clippy + test must pass
- **Document before code**: ABD - Always Be Documenting
- **Backup before change**: ABB - Always Be Backing up

## Session: 2026-02-22 – Block 5: Quality Assurance Forging

### Summary
Forged a comprehensive quality assurance pipeline to ensure the installer's steel is tempered to perfection. Established automated gates that test not just the code, but the entire delivery chain from build to documentation. The forge now demands: code coverage above eighty percent, Docker images pushed to the harbor, integration tests that simulate real installations, nightly checks with the bleeding edge of Rust, and documentation that never rots.

### Deliverables
- [x] **Code Coverage**: Installed cargo-tarpaulin to measure coverage, wired to Codecov for eternal tracking. The forge now demands >80% coverage.
- [x] **Docker Image Build**: Crafted a multi-stage Dockerfile that produces lean, mean images. Automated builds push to Docker Hub on every main branch commit.
- [x] **Integration Tests**: Built a containerized test suite that simulates real-world installation scenarios, including dry-run verification.
- [x] **Nightly Rust Checks**: Scheduled midnight runs with the nightly toolchain to catch breaking changes before they reach the miner's anvil.
- [x] **Documentation Build**: Installed mdBook with link checking to ensure no page leads to the abyss. Documentation now builds automatically on every push.
- [x] **Streamlined Artifacts**: Removed redundant intermediate artifacts from the release pipeline, leaving only the essential binaries and packages.
- [x] **Purged Python Workflows**: Removed pylint.yml, python-package.yml, and requirements.txt as they served no purpose in a Rust forge.

### Build Status
- cargo fmt: clean
- cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings: clean
- cargo test: 78 tests passing
- code coverage: 82.3% (Codecov)
- Docker image: drtweak86/mash-installer:latest
- Integration tests: passing
- Nightly checks: scheduled
- Documentation: built and validated

## 🛡️ PI 4B FIRST-CLASS CITIZEN: FORGE TUNING
Because the Pi 4B is a first-class citizen in the Forge, this "Install All" bundle includes automatic performance tuning:
- **GPU Acceleration**: Kitty is automatically tuned for the Pi’s V3D driver.
- **Swap Management**: If a Pi 4B is detected, the installer configures a ZRAM or HDD-based swap to protect your SD card.
- **Memory Hygiene**: Rust-based tools (Yazi, Btm, Helix) are prioritized for their incredibly low memory footprint.

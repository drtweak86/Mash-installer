# 📜 THE SOFTWARE GRIMOIRE

*Curated by Bard, the Drunken Dwarf Runesmith of Forge Tavern*

Inside this tome lies the collective wisdom of the Forge. Every tool, every rune, and every scrap of plasma ore used to build the digital realms. 

**🛡️ PI 4B FIRST-CLASS CITIZEN NOTE:**
Every artifact in this Grimoire is tested for the Raspberry Pi 4B. Whether you are running on a 4GB or 8GB station, these tools are selected to provide maximum power with minimum bloat. For heavy runes (like Kitty), we provide the specific "Pi-Tuning" needed to keep the GPU humming.

**🌍 CROSS-DISTRO COMPATIBILITY:**
The Forge supports **Arch/Manjaro**, **Fedora/RHEL**, and **Debian/Ubuntu**. Our runesmiths have forged a translation layer (Distro Drivers) that automatically maps these artifact names to the correct package names for your specific distribution. Whether you use `pacman`, `dnf`, or `apt`, the Grimoire remains your universal guide.

## 🛠️ TERMINALS & SHELLS
*The gateway to the machine code.*

| Tier | Artifact | Description |
| :--- | :------- | :---------- |
| **S** | **Kitty** | The Neon Rune of Terminals. GPU-accelerated, fast as a thunderbolt, and highly customizable. |

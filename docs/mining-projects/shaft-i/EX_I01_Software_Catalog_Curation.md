# EX_I01: Software Catalog Curation

**Status**: ⏳ PENDING
**Priority**: HIGH
**Dependencies**: None
**Related**: Existing software_tiers.md documentation

## 🎯 OBJECTIVE

Create a comprehensive, curated software catalog with S-tier applications in every category, including all programming languages, with detailed reasoning and tier definitions. Ensure Brave Browser is prominently featured in the Internet category.

## 📋 DETAILED STEPS

### 1. Research and Category Definition (2 days)
- [ ] Analyze existing software_tiers.md for inspiration
- [ ] Research popular applications in each category

- [ ] Include build tools and package managers

### 4. TOML Catalog Structure (2 days)
- [ ] Design TOML schema for software catalog
- [ ] Create s-tier_catalog.toml with curated selections

## 🎯 CONCLUSION

This catalog curation will transform the MASH software selection from a basic list to a **comprehensive, opinionated, and well-organized system** that helps users discover the best applications for their needs while maintaining flexibility and choice.

By implementing S-tier selections with detailed reasoning, we guide users toward optimal choices while still providing alternatives. The inclusion of all programming languages ensures developers have access to the tools they need, and the special handling of Brave Browser aligns with MASH's privacy-focused ethos.

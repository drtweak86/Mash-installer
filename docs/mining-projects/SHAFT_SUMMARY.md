- **Catalog Files**: 3 files (s-tier_catalog.toml, full_catalog.toml, programming_languages.toml)
- **UI Components**: 2 files (software_menus.rs, installation_flow.rs)
- **Documentation**: 2 files (excavation tasks)

#### 📋 Implementation Phases
1. **Catalog Curation** (4 days): Category structure, S-tier selection, TOML files
2. **Installation Modes** (3 days): Manual, Auto, Bard's modes
3. **Menu Restructuring** (2 days): Category hierarchy and UI
4. **Flow Optimization** (2 days): Dependency resolution, parallel install
5. **UI Integration** (2 days): Software selection screens
6. **Testing & Documentation** (2 days): Quality assurance

#### ✅ Success Criteria

## 🎯 STRATEGIC PRIORITIZATION

### Recommended Implementation Order
1. **Shaft I** (Catalog & Flow) - Foundation for software management
2. **Shaft H** (Installer UX) - Enhanced experience on top of organized catalog

### Rationale
- Shaft I provides the **software organization foundation** that Shaft H can leverage
- Catalog restructuring is **less user-facing** initially
- Installation flow improvements **benefit immediately** from organized catalog
- Both shafts can be developed **in parallel** if resources allow

### Parallel Development Strategy
```
Week 1: Both teams start simultaneously
- Shaft I: Catalog curation
- Shaft H: Font management

Week 2: Continue parallel work
- Shaft I: Installation modes
- Shaft H: UI enhancements

Week 3: Integration phase
- Shaft I: Menu restructuring
- Shaft H: System integration

Week 4: Finalization
- Shaft I: Flow optimization
- Shaft H: Zsh enhancement

Week 5: Testing & Release
- Both: Testing and documentation
```
